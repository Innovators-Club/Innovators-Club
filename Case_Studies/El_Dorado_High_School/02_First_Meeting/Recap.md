#First Meeting Recap

##What We Did

- Talked about improving the local community with STEM.
- Talked about club goals and future workshops we will be doing.
- Asked the crowd some questions to make sure they were excited/pumped for the club activities.
- Showed a news video on a high school makerspace and our virtual reality demo from last year on our YouTube channel
- Announced an upcoming 3D Model/3D Print workshop.

##How It Differed From Our Plan
- More people showed up than expected (25 people, about every seat was taken in the class).
- Smash Bros Club (a new, hugely popular 80-100 people club) had their first meeting today, which reduced the number of people attending Innovators Club.
- We didn't go over club officer positions, but that's fine, we can just do it on the following meeting before our first workshop at our third meeting.

##What Went Well
- More people showed up than expected! Woo! Pretty much every seat was taken.
- Most of the girls who signed up showed up!
- The enthusiasm/curiosity to learn destroyed our expectations. EVERYONE was interested in learning and attending workshops. Even fine with the one-time $20 makerspace fee for our hardware workshops.

##What Didn't Go Well
- We spent too much time talking about how STEM can change the community in the beginning. At least we had enough time for everyone, kind of.

##Misc
- We noticed that barely anyone was eating their lunch. We'll make sure in other meetings, we'll make it clear that our meetigns take up most of lunch, but you can come in late to get your lunch.

##Tips For Other Organizers
- Have a good speaker in your staff to speak in front of the club.
- Make sure that you don't talk forever and give a chance for the crowd to ask questions.
- Be straight to the point about your club and don't talk about other stuff (well you can, but primary focus should be on club stuff).
