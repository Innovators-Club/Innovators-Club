#Second Meeting Recap

##What Happened

- We talked about our schedule for future workshops.
- Went over our 3D printing workshop to ensue on the third meeting
- Collected donations

##What Didn't Go Well
- We somehow took the whole period for the meeting, instead of an expected 15 minutes or less.

##Tips for Other Organizers
- Like I've said before, and apparently we didn't learn on our own so far, be concise and to the point with your meetings. Don't take forever to talk about something.
