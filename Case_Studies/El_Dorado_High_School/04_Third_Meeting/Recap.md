#Third Meeting Recap

##What Happened
- We used the computer lab to host an intro to 3D Modeling with Tinkercad and 3D Printing workshop
- More than 15 people showed up today for the workshop
- Link to the workshop we used: https://c.srnd.co/t/3d-modeling-for-beginners/100

##Problems We Faced
- Our workshop was a 3D modelling/3D printing workshop, but minus the 3D printing. We didn't get to go over our
powerpoint on 3D printing technology because we didn't have enough time (our workshop was during lunch which is 
30 minutes).
- People got off topic and started making their own stuff on Tinkercad. This is fine, but this shows that we should
have workshops with more freedom to do whatever they want (not exactly off topic, but creating something
different), otherwise students will get bored. This will be noted for our next workshop.
- We were heavily unpreprared. I (one of the co-presidents) had never used Tinkercad up until the time of the
workshop. I had my other co-president read off the workshop guide for the rest of the class while I did as he said,
with the computer mirrored onto the smart board. This helped to cover up the fact that I was not teaching the class,
but going along with the workshop with them. Not good.

##Tips For Other Organizers
- Don't expect people to not get bored of your workshops. Let them do whatever they want, while teaching them how
to do stuff. Put emphasis on freedom to do whatever they want to do with the resources you give them.
- BEFORE YOU SCHEDULE A WORKSHOP, PLEASE BE SURE THAT YOU ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THE WORKSHOP. This helps to ensure that if something comes up, and you end up being busy leading up to the workshop day, you will actually be somewhat prepared. Always be prepared!!!!!! Can't stress that enough.
