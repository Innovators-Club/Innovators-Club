#Sixth Meeting Recap

##What Happened
- We assigned two people to be publicists to help with our outreach and one more vice president to help alleviate the co-presidents' workload.
- Announced that we had a guest speaker (senior mechanical engineer at Boeing) coming to ur next meeting
- Received more donations, bringing this year's total donations to $200 ($20 per student) + $110 from teachers

##Problems We Faced
- We realized that our club turnout is still steadily decreasing, with a record low of 12 attendees today. These
 members have been consistently attending our meetings, so it's safe to say that we have a minimum of 12 active members.
