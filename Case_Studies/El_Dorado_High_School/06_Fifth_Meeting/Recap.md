#Fifth Meeting Recap

##What Happened

- 12 + 1 alumni showed up today
- We did a modified, faster Portfolio workshop. Was it just as good as going through the entire thing? No one
  was confused, so I guess not. 
- We did not pair up people in groups like in the original workshop, didn't feel the need to do so.
- Our new total for club donations = $140, or 7 people turning in their $20 donations.

##Problems That We Faced
- Only 12 people showed up. So we went from 25 -> 25 -> 17 -> 17 -> 12 (this meeting) people show up. That's bad.
  We were hoping that the drop from 52 initial signups to 25 would clear up most of the people who figured out whether
  or not they would find this club interesting. I guess not. Our new goal for club attendance is to never again dip below
  15 attendees.
- One person was late, and he ended up lost so he just went on Tinkercad. Three other people were also off topic. So about
4 or 5 out of the 12 people who showed up weren't doing the workshop. This is bad. For obvious reasons. What we really
 don't understand is why people can't just stay on topic, despite the very modular workshop we had where people could
 make any website they wanted really.
- We realized that we need to increase the club staff size AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. We need people to walk around, talk with the club members more frequently, stuff like that.

##Tips For Other Organizers
- Get a club officer dedicated to purely outreach to get as many people as possible to join the club and attend workshops.
- Get alot of club officers to keep everyone on topic and talk with members during the workshops.
