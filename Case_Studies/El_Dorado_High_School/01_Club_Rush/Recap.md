#Club Rush: Day 1

##What We Did

- Encouraged people to sign up.
- Showed off the Vilros Arduino Ultimate Starter Kit and 3D printed stuff like a Terminator head, skull, pokemon, phone cases.
- Told people about our club goals and activities.

##How it Differed From Our Plan

- We didn't get a VR headset or custom PC for VR demos; it seemed like a bad investment
- More people signed up than we expected

##What Went Well
- More people signed up than we expected!
- Got a few girls interested in signing up.
- Got 32 sign-ups on Day 1 alone.

##What Didn't Go Well
- We couldn't get an arduino demo from the starter kit running because the club staff was too busy to pre-program the arduino before the event and simply assemble the arduino again during the event. So we just took out the arduino and breadboard and stuff and let people look at stuff we're gonna work on during the year.
- We didn't have the password for our club advisor's laptop which we needed to program and power the arduino, and to type in the club signups, so we had to improvise by using a crappy piece of lined paper and had people put their info on it (very sloppy).

##Tips for Other Organizers

- Make sure you have proper access (including wifi and password) to a laptop to type in sign up information instead of using a crappy piece of paper filled with hard to read handwriting.
- Have girl staff members on board to attract girl signups. We noticed that after two girls showed up at our table, a couple other girls passed by and saw the two girls signing up for our club, making them feel more welcome to join our club, and not feel like it's a "boy's" club, and so they came over and signed up.
- Make sure you get better attention grabbers. We got lucky (or I guess people were that excited to touch/see something 3D printed...), and were next to the Sci-Fi Fantasy table, which had a working custom built R2-D2 moving around their table...

#Club Rush: Day 2

##What We Did
- Same thing as yesterday
- Brought a headless Raspberry Pi to show off

##What Went Well
- More people than expected (since this is the second day, and usually the least popular) at Club Rush, Day 2.
- Again, got a few girls signed up.
- 24 people signed up today
- A Macbook Air was brought to program the Arduino to blink LEDs which was a cool tech demo.
- We used the macbook to have people type in their signup information instead of writing it on a piece of paper. So much better than handwriting...

##What Didn't Go Well
- Everything went well!

##Tips for Other Organizers
- To get even more attention than we did today, get better attention grabbers.
- Same as yesterday's tips.
