#Fourth Meeting Recap

##What Happened

- We used the computer lab to mess around in Tinkercad and see what we can make. People could make whatever they want
 (we learned from the last meeting that we should give people more freedom, or they'll get bored and leave the club).
- 17 people, not counting the co-presidents, showed up today. About the same as last week. Somehow, we dropped from 25
 people in out first and escond meetings, down to 17 for the third and fourth meetings. Could it be because people thought
 the club wasn't well organized? People can't remember meetings? People can't remember the room number of the computer lab
 instead of the original club classroom?
- We showed a brief powerpoint presentation on 3D printing technology. Most of the period was just tinkering around on TinkerCad

##Problems We Faced
- Again, 17 people showed up. About the same as last week. Somehow, we dropped from 25
 people in out first and escond meetings, down to 17 for the third and fourth meetings. Could it be because people thought
 the club wasn't well organized? People can't remember meetings? (actually, some people said that we should tone down the amount of
text reminders we send out to remind people about meetings, because it can be a bit bothersome.) People can't remember the room number of the computer lab
 instead of the original club classroom? These problems will nede to be addressed somehow.
- Didn't really do anything "exciting" today. Had nothing on the agenda to do. This Friday we're doing the Portfolio workshop.
- Barely anyone paid attention to the powerpoint (people were on Tinkercad). But that was kinda okay, since we told everyone to do whatever they wanted on Tinkercad. But still, wish we had more interest.

##Tips For Other Organizers
- MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GOOD VICE PRESIDENTS, AND TWO OF THEM. We really could use some vice presidents to do some planning for us.
- Always be on the lookout for potential problems in your meetings.
- GET FEEDBACK FROM YOUR MEMBERS. You need to figure out what you're doing wrong or right ASAP, or your club is doomed to fail.
